Using the log-returns

> "*A popular model for log-returns of stock markets is a GARCH model.*"

The author say it because the GARCH models is used for of high fluctuations (volatility of the financial markets) and when they can see a volatility clustering 

## Chong, C.W., Ahmad, M.I., Abdullah, M.Y., 1999. Performance of GARCH models in forecasting stock market volatility. Journal of Forecasting 18, 333–343.

> "*One of the alternatives of non-linear models that can cope with skewness is the Exponential GARCH or EGARCH model introduced by Nelson (1990). For stock indices, Nelson's exponential GARCH is proven to be the best model of the conditional heteroscedasticity.*"

If the GARCH model doesn't provide a good results maybe i should try to use the EGARCH model

## Franses, P.H., Van Dijk, D., 1996. Forecasting stock market volatility using (non-linear) Garch models. Journal of Forecasting 15, 229–235.

Quadratic GARCH = QGARCH (Engle and Ng,1993)

Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle GARCH = GJR GARCH (Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle, 1992)

These models are used for describe the often observed negative skewness in stock market indices

> I have to verify if the NASDAQ(daily) have a negative skewness 

Yes the NASDAQ have a little negative skewness (-0.37)

In this article the QGARCH model seems the best for forcasting

The GARCH model can remove the excess kurtosis in returns

They use the Median of Squared Error (MedSE)
