Using the log-returns

> "*A popular model for log-returns of stock markets is a GARCH model.*"

The author say it because the GARCH models is used for of high fluctuations (volatility of the financial markets) and when they can see a volatility clustering 

### Chong, C.W., Ahmad, M.I., Abdullah, M.Y., 1999. Performance of GARCH models in forecasting stock market volatility. Journal of Forecasting 18, 333–343.

> "*One of the alternatives of non-linear models that can cope with skewness is the Exponential GARCH or EGARCH model introduced by Nelson (1990). For stock indices, Nelson's exponential GARCH is proven to be the best model of the conditional heteroscedasticity.*"

If the GARCH model doesn't provide a good results maybe i should try to use the EGARCH model

All the article doesn't have a large dataset like me. Even if their data was in daily i should to try with a smallest dataset


### Advice from chatgpt
 
Take high-frequency data for forecasting can be a good idea but the using of the log-returns of a stock market index with data in 1min doesn't work well because of the noise of market microstructure 

I will make a new data set with a frenquency of "5min"

Try with NASDAQ in 5min
